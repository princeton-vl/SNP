# Setup
We recommend installing the dependencies using Anaconda. Run the following commands to create a new env:
```
conda create -n snp python=3.8
conda activate snp
conda install pytorch=1.9.0 torchvision=0.10.0 cudatoolkit=11.1 -c pytorch -c nvidia
conda install -c fvcore -c iopath -c conda-forge fvcore iopath
conda install pytorch3d -c pytorch3d
conda install -c conda-forge plyfile imageio imageio-ffmpeg matplotlib tensorboard ffmpeg=4.3
pip install opencv-python==4.5.3.56 lpips==0.1.4 moviepy
```

Note: you will need a NVIDIA GPU with at least 11 GB memory to run the pre-trained checkpoints on LLFF and 48GB memory (we use A6000) to fully reproduce our results in the paper.

# Prepare the Datasets
You can find the pre-processed DTU and LLFF datasets in the [Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/189nUV9_9YM_0bLW1Y97SQ1nK_EVpxGW6?usp=sharing).

TanksAndTemples (TNT) dataset is under this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZH1zTbl6c5QtTJyxfTG1toVEPSkdSwXz/view?usp=share_link).

Put the raw data and depths under `./data`.

The datasets should have the following structure:
```                                                                                           
├── data                                                                                                                                                                                                       
│   ├── DTU                                                                                                  
│   │   └── depths

# Evaluate the Pre-trained Models
The easiest way to get started is to try our pre-trained checkpoints.

You can find the saved checkpoints/pointclouds in the [Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/189nUV9_9YM_0bLW1Y97SQ1nK_EVpxGW6?usp=sharing).

Put the downloaded `*.pth` and `*.pt` under `./saved_checkpoints` and `./saved_pointclouds`, respectively.

For the TNT dataset, the checkpoints and pointclouds are in [this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GVO5v8XZO0Navh50eIvpiYAYbvr56g6K?usp=share_link) and [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eSVGHC6NFr06rW0xbR94b1wytntSbDqm/view?usp=share_link), respectively.

The checkpoints' file size could be large. Therefore, you can download the checkpoints on each individual scenes separately, but please put them following this structure:

```                                                                                           
├── saved_checkpoints                                                                                                                                                                                                      
│   ├── DTU                                                                                                  
│   │   └── ..._scan1_....pth   # checkpoints for the scan1 scene 
|   |   └── ...                                                                        
|   ├── LLFF
|   |   └── ..._fern_....pth   # checkpoints for the fern scene 
|   |   └── ...  
|   ├── TNT
|   |   └── ..._Ignatius....pth   # checkpoints for the Ignatius scene 
|   |   └── ...  
|
├── saved_pointclouds                                                                                                                                                                                                      
│   ├── DTU                                                                                                  
│   │   └── ..._scan1_....pt   # sculpted pointclouds for the scan1 scene 
|   |   └── ...                                                                        
|   ├── LLFF
|   |   └── ..._fern_....pt   # sculpted pointclouds for the fern scene 
|   |   └── ...  
|   ├── TNT
|   |   └── Ignatius.ply   # sculpted pointclouds for the Ignatius scene 
|   |   └── ...  
```

Then run the following command:
```
sh eval.sh <dataset_name> <scene_name>
```
Where `<dataset_name>` is `DTUHR` for the DTU dataset and `LLFF` for the LLFF dataset.

For example, if you run 
```
sh eval.sh LLFF fern
```
you will find this GIF in `./saved_videos` and the evaluation numbers are printed in the command line.

# Train from Scratch
Run
```
sh train.sh <dataset_name> <scene_name>
```
to train the whole pipeline (including point sculpting and the final training). It takes about 14 hours on a single A6000 GPU.

You can find the tensorboard logs under `./tb` folder. The final checkpoints and pointclouds will be stored under `./checkpoints` and `./pointclouds`, respectively.

Note: for people who don't have GPUs with 48GB memory and/or want higher rendering speed, there are a few hyperparameters that you can play with. From our experience, changing these values (in a reasonable range) has a minor effect on the rendered image quality.

- Reduce `max_num_pts` which controls the point cloud size.
- Adjust `crop_h` and `crop_w` to control the image resolution.
